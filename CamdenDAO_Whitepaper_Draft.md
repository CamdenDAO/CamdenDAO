## 📄 Executive Summary

CamdenDAO is a decentralized protocol committed to transparency, fairness, and shared benefit through a healthcare-focused decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).  
Born from the real-world needs of families, clinics, and technologists in Camden, NJ, this DAO powers tools like the Consent Trace Dashboard, the $MAP staking economy, and clinic dividend frameworks.

---

## 🌍 Vision & Mission

**Vision:**  
A world where every person owns their consent, shares in the value of fixing broken systems, and participates in building stronger, fairer digital public goods.

**Mission:**  
To decentralize health system governance through traceable consent, anti-waste technology, and community-shared dividends.

---

## 🔑 The Four Pillars

Inspired by *Stable Genius 3*, CamdenDAO implements:

1. **Consolidated Systems** – Blockchain-based consent ledgers and schema unification  
2. **Redirect Waste** – Waste Detector and auto-flagging for refund/dividend routing  
3. **Scale Investment Upfront** – $MAP staking, validator rewards, schema adoption bonuses  
4. **Holistic ROI** – Dashboards measuring consent, safety, savings, and satisfaction

## 🏛 Governance & Participation

CamdenDAO uses an equitable, layered model that rewards care—not just code.

### 🔍 Consent Trace Dashboard

Visualizes consent, care, dividends, and DAO activity  
✅ Enables “Proof-of-Care” validation and review

---

### ✂️ Slashing & Repair Path

CamdenDAO uses a **Slashing Tree** with a parallel **Repair Track** to allow redemption:

- **Level 1 – Reflection Track**  
  Community review, plain-language violation explanation

- **Level 2 – Stewardship Track**  
  Shadow validation & learning contributions

- **Level 3 – Earnback Track**  
  Small stake reinstatement via peer nomination

---

### 🪜 Fork Governance

- In deep disagreements, proposals may **fork**  
- Members choose path  
- Forks remain visible in the Consent Dashboard

---

## 🌐 Local Value Capture: Civic Toll Booth (Proposal in Review)

A future DAO vote may introduce a **local internet toll logic**—a micro-dividend model to return value from digital infrastructure back to CamdenDAO.

### Model Overview:

- CamdenDAO-aligned clinics/tools register as **verified providers**  
- A programmable % of earnings flow to DAO  
- Funds distributed to:
  - Cleanup teams  
  - Youth training hubs  
  - Local health infrastructure
