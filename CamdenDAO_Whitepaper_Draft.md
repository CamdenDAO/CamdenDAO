## A Decentralized Health, Consent, and Dividend Infrastructure

## Executive Summary
CamdenDAO is a decentralized protocol committed to transparency, fairness, and shared benefit through a healthcare-focused decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Born from the real-world needs of families, clinics, and technologists in Camden, NJ, this DAO powers tools like the Consent Trace Dashboard, the $MAP staking economy, and clinic dividend frameworks.

## Vision & Mission

**Vision:** A world where every person owns their consent, shares in the value of fixing broken systems, and participates in building stronger, fairer digital public goods.

**Mission:** To decentralize health system governance through traceable consent, anti-waste technology, and community-shared dividends.

---

## The Four Pillars

Inspired by *Stable Genius 3*, CamdenDAO implements:

1. **Consolidated Systems** — Blockchain-based consent ledgers and schema unification.
2. **Redirect Waste** — Waste Detector and auto-flagging errors for refund/dividend routing.
3. **Scale Investment Upfront** — $MAP staking, validator rewards, and schema adoption bonuses.
4. **Holistic ROI** — Monthly dashboards measuring consent, safety, savings, and satisfaction.

## Core Components

### 1. $MAP Token

- **Symbol:** $MAP
- **Function:** Utility + governance token
- **Use Cases:** Validator staking, DAO voting, dividend eligibility, audit challenges

### 2. ConsentLedger.sol

- Tracks on-chain consent actions by wallet and topic
- Transparent, auditable, and fully indexable

### 3. Waste Detector (v1)

- Off-chain tool scanning billing anomalies
- Routes findings to DAO review and dividend calculations

### 4. Camden Commons Dividend Engine

- Every $100 of recovered value:
  - $70 goes back to users
  - $20 funds local public health upgrades
  - $10 powers infrastructure & DAO ops

## Governance

- **Structure:** Quadratic voting, validator thresholds, slashing logic tree
- **Tools:** DAO dashboard, proposal system, feedback channels
- **Policies:** Open-source data governance, traceable rule changes, audit logs

---

## Ethical Framework

CamdenDAO aligns with:
- HIPAA, HITECH, FD&C §524B (device data)
- AICPA and anti-fraud principles
- A strict slashing enforcement ladder to prevent abuse

---

## Roadmap

**Phase 1:** Pilot ConsentLedger + Dashboard at Camden Commons Clinic  
**Phase 2:** Launch $MAP Staking and Validator Network  
**Phase 3:** Expand schema to regional clinics + health alliances  
**Phase 4:** DAO-wide dividend reporting, open integrations, and youth training hub
