## Executive Summary

CamdenDAO is a decentralized protocol committed to transparency, fairness, and shared benefit through a healthcare-focused decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).  
Born from the real-world needs of families, clinics, and technologists in Camden, NJ, this DAO powers tools like the Consent Trace Dashboard, the $MAP staking economy, and clinic dividend frameworks.

---

## Vision & Mission

**Vision:**  
A world where every person owns their consent, shares in the value of fixing broken systems, and participates in building stronger, fairer digital public goods.

**Mission:**  
To decentralize health system governance through traceable consent, anti-waste technology, and community-shared dividends.

---

## The Four Pillars

Inspired by *Stable Genius 3*, CamdenDAO implements:

1. **Consolidated Systems** – Blockchain-based consent ledgers and schema unification  
2. **Redirect Waste** – Waste Detector and auto-flagging for refund/dividend routing  
3. **Scale Investment Upfront** – $MAP staking, validator rewards, schema adoption bonuses  
4. **Holistic ROI** – Dashboards measuring consent, safety, savings, and satisfaction

---

## Core Components

### $MAP Token Allocation

**Updated Distribution:**

- **Community Treasury** – 30%  
  Supports proposals, public upgrades, and care innovations.

- **Protocol Incentives** – 25%  
  Rewards for validators, consent attestation, repair work, and Proof of Care actions.

- **Founding Team** – 10%  
  Vested over 4 years. No early unlocks.

- **Governance & Reputation Recovery** – 15%  
  Used for repair tracks, youth sandbox staking, and slashing recovery.

- **Partnerships & Ecosystem** – 10%  
  For clinics, education hubs, and verified contributors.

- **Liquidity & Market Access** – 10%

### ConsentLedger.sol

- Tracks on-chain consent by wallet and topic  
- Transparent, auditable, fully indexable

---

### Waste Detector (v1)

- Off-chain tool scanning billing anomalies  
- Routes flagged data to DAO review & dividend system

---

### Camden Commons Dividend Engine

For every $100 of recovered value:

- $70 → Returned to users  
- $20 → Local public health upgrades  
- $10 → DAO operations & infrastructure

---

## Governance & Participation

CamdenDAO uses an equitable, layered model that rewards care—not just code.

### Consent Trace Dashboard

Visualizes consent, care, dividends, and DAO activity  
Enables “Proof-of-Care” validation and review

---

### Slashing & Repair Path

CamdenDAO uses a **Slashing Tree** with a parallel **Repair Track** to allow redemption:

- **Level 1 – Reflection Track**  
  Community review, plain-language violation explanation

- **Level 2 – Stewardship Track**  
  Shadow validation & learning contributions

- **Level 3 – Earnback Track**  
  Small stake reinstatement via peer nomination

---

### Fork Governance

- In deep disagreements, proposals may **fork**  
- Members choose path  
- Forks remain visible in the Consent Dashboard

---

## Local Value Capture: Civic Toll Booth (Proposal in Review)

A future DAO vote may introduce a **local internet toll logic**—a micro-dividend model to return value from digital infrastructure back to CamdenDAO.

### Model Overview:

- CamdenDAO-aligned clinics/tools register as **verified providers**  
- A programmable % of earnings flow to DAO  
- Funds distributed to:
  - Cleanup teams  
  - Youth training hubs  
  - Local health infrastructure

## Ethical Framework

CamdenDAO complies with:

- HIPAA, HITECH, FD&C §524B  
- AICPA audit & anti-fraud standards  
- Public audit logs, slashing rules, and open data governance

---

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1:** Pilot ConsentLedger + Dashboard at Camden Commons Clinic  
- **Phase 2:** Launch $MAP staking & validator rewards  
- **Phase 3:** Expand schema to regional clinics & health alliances  
- **Phase 4:** DAO-wide dividend engine + youth validator training hub
