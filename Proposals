## Summary

This proposal introduces a pilot initiative to explore **community-governed cleanup and infrastructure funding** via a **DAO-powered toll mechanism** in the City of Camden. 

The concept blends real-world civic renewal with decentralized accountability: if digital infrastructure extracts value from Camden, the community should earn a share back through verified cleanup, care, and stewardship.

---

## Objectives

- Establish a **Civic Toll** mechanism tied to internet traffic, verified geolocation, or public sector access
- Direct a % of toll proceeds to:
  - DAO-verified clean-up initiatives (e.g. waterfront pollution, broken walkways)
  - Public health & infrastructure (including parks, air quality, and digital equity)
  - DAO contributors who track, validate, or participate in cleanups via Consent Trace Dashboard

---

## How It Works (Pilot Design)

1. **Smart Toll Layer**
   - Deployed on city or partnership-owned infrastructure (Wi-Fi, public data nodes, network access)
   - Transparent, tokenized logging of access events tied to geographic zones

2. **Consent Trace Cleanup Protocol**
   - Community nominates areas for cleanup or repair (like the Camden waterfront)
   - Actions validated via Proof of Care, Waste Detector, and Geo-tagged attestation

3. **Dividends Distributed**
   - % of civic toll flows to:
     - $MAP holders who stake on successful cleanups
     - Clean-up teams, validators, and DAO contributors
     - CamdenDAO Civic Infrastructure Fund

---

## Governance and Safeguards

- Proposals require full DAO vote (or multisig council) for:
  - Toll rate changes
  - Payout logic
  - New zone inclusion
- Pilot capped at 6 months with full community review

---

## Strategic Rationale

This is not a surveillance toll. It’s a **community dividend mechanism**:

> “If value flows through our neighborhoods, care should flow back.”

It honors those who maintain the commons, make visible what’s ignored, and prototype decentralized civic trust.

---

## Notes

- Pilot requires partnerships with city infrastructure stakeholders, possibly in hybrid (off-chain + on-chain) format
- Considered “non-extractive” — Camden residents can opt out and still benefit through public infrastructure dividends
- CamdenDAO reserves the right to sunset, fork, or redesign based on pilot data and feedback
