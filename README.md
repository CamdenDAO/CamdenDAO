# CamdenDAO

**A decentralized protocol for consent, care, and community dividends.**

CamdenDAO is a community-driven initiative emerging from The Curiosity Project and *Stable Genius*. We’re building a governance layer for real-world equity using web3 tools — with health care as our first use case.

## 🔍 What We’re Doing

- Enabling patients to **track consent**
- Reducing **waste in billing systems**
- Sharing **dividends with the community** when outcomes improve

## 📍 Pilot Site

Camden Commons Clinic will be the first test location for:

- Smart contracts that log consent and usage
- Dashboards for stakeholders
- $MAP token staking and dividends

## 🚀 Status

We’re preparing for testnet launch (Dec 2025) on the Ethereum Sepolia network. Smart contracts and documentation are in development.
