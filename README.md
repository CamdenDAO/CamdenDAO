# CamdenDAO: The Curiosity Project Protocol

Welcome to **CamdenDAO**, a decentralized protocol for health equity, consent-first infrastructure, and community dividends. Built by The Curiosity Project and Camden Commons Clinic, this project reimagines care through transparent, programmable systems that prioritize people—not just data.
